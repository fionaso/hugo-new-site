First and foremost, I declare the struggle of writing the introduction sentence for your very first post real and I am left wondering: what will be easier? Learning JavaScript, writing blog posts on a regular basis or even bolder, keeping this blog alive?

Great start. Moving on.

**#Why learning JavaScript? There are millions of reasons.**

+ Yes, programming languages are officially perceived as « dope ». 
+ Yes, there’s lots of money to make.
+ Yes, you could potentially work from home, everyday.
+ Yes, it is the most popular programming language
+ Yes, there are tons of job opportunities for all levels.

Whether it is related or not to your current job, knowing how to program can only benefit you. 

+ It might be that you have a blog and would like to make it pretty without pay astronomical $$.  
+ It might be that you want to change career and in that case, Welcome to the world of opportunities. 
+ It might be that you need it for work. 
+ It might also be that you have your own business and would like to be on top of things.

**#Is it difficult?**

Well, as long as you have the will, I believe everything is easier. As with everything, the key is to practice, practice and practice. The first approach is to think of something that would be cool to build, have a goal. It doesn’t have to be ambitious. Motto: starting small to evolve big. 

**#Keeping up with JavaScript: my plan**

I will post all the learning from my course on this blog. From the basics to hopefully some very cool experiments with the full code available. I ~~might~~ **will** break the experiment or in fact the whole blog so apologies in advance. I’ve heard that was the destiny of every developer.

So without further ado, let’s break things!
