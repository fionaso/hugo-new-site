Writing your first JavaScript code starts with a little refresh. 
Once you’re decided on a code editor – for me, it is Brackets – it’s time to start writing your first piece of JavaScript code.
But first, some reminders to make sure we get the very basic stuff.

**#HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT***
HTML – this is what holds the content of your website.
CSS – this is what makes your content “prettier” in terms of layout, style and presentation.
JS – this is what interacts with your users.

**#CLIENT SIDE / SERVER SIDE**
Now, there’s two sides of it: the client-side generally known as front-end and the sever-side generally known as back-end. Here’s an easier way to think of it:
+	A client-side code runs in the web browser and therefore reacts immediately to a user’s input. 
+ A server-side code runs on the web server meaning before the page is downloaded.

**#JAVA AIN’T JAVASCRIPT**
Another point I’d like to mention is a common misconception: JavaScript is not Java. Java is not JavaScript. I do see why so many of us make this mistake though. Little story short, JavaScript was initially called Mocha, then it was renamed as LiveScript, and then JavaScript. Why JavaScript? I read somewhere it was because at the time, Java was the HOT language so in a bid to make JavaScript more popular, the “Java” bit was added for marketing purposes.
