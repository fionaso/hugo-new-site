Although JavaScript has a different syntax compared with HTML & CSS, the language is still easy to learn as it's written in plain english. That means, no crazy Matrix-like codes that only you and you peers can understand. <!--more-->
But more importantly (and that's only an assumption at this point), it will make it much easier to debug and for others (you, the reader) to understand.

Let's have a look at JavaScript basics.

**#JavaScript is case sensitive.**

**#JavaScript is made up of statements**#
that should always end with a semicolon like so: console log(“Hello World”);. 

**#JavaScript accepts comments**
Comments can be written within your code to further explain a line or add important details however, it is important to note how to properly insert a comment. There are two ways:
-	Comments on one line can be inserted by adding “//” right before the comment
-	Comments on multiple lines can be inserted like so: “/*[comment]*/”

**#JavaScript codes are organised**
Similarly to other languages, your goal should be broken down into a series of tasks that are as detailed as possible to enable JavaScript to understand and complete that goal. The code is processed from top to bottom
