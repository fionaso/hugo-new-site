A COMPILATION OF JAVASCRIPT BASICS
JavaScript is case sensitive.
JavaScript is made up of statements that should always end with a semicolon like so: console log(“Hello World”);. 
Comments can be written within your code to further explain a line or add important details however, it is important to note how to properly insert a comment. There are two ways:
-	Comments on one line can be inserted by adding “//” right before the comment
-	Comments on multiple lines can be inserted like so: “/*[comment]*/”
Similarly to other languages, your goal should be broken down into a series of tasks that are as detailed as possible to enable JavaScript to understand and complete that goal. The code is processed from top to bottom
